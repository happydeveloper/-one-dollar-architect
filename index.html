          </h1>
          <p>
            You're here because you have a problem. Maybe you need a website built, an app developed, 
            a subscription system set up, or your existing system's performance fixed. Whatever your 
            technical challenge, <strong>I can help you solve it, and there's no risk</strong> — start with just $1.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I've been doing this work seriously for almost 20 years.</strong> I am a senior 
            system architect with extensive real-world experience. I can build websites and apps, 
            create subscription systems, fix performance problems, design global payment systems, 
            build large-scale email systems, and help you reduce infrastructure costs. 
            <strong>With nearly two decades of experience, I can definitely help you.</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            <strong>I prefer to communicate via email. Share your situation — whether you need a 
            new website, app development, a subscription site, global payment systems, large-scale 
            email infrastructure, performance optimization, or help reducing costs — and I'll provide 
            you with concrete solutions I can deliver. I can actually reduce your infrastructure costs 
            while maintaining or improving performance.</strong>

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I help you design, build, or repair systems that must not fail. Even very small
        issues can become critical later — I focus on fixing the foundations and
        making them observable and measurable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I can solve app performance problems, build global payment systems, create 
        large-scale email infrastructure, and actually reduce your costs</strong> — all based 
        on almost 20 years of serious, real-world experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I approach problems from multiple angles and different levels of abstraction.</strong> 
        I can view your system from various perspectives — code level, architecture level, business 
        level, operational level — and find the best solutions. Good problems require good solutions, 
        and I bring multiple viewpoints to ensure we solve the right problem in the right way.

          <h3>Track Record</h3>
          <h2>Why You Can Trust Me</h2>
          <p>
            You don’t need another generic agency. You need someone who has already
            built, broken, and fixed real systems at scale — and lived with them in production.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Built and operated a very large WordPress + WooCommerce subscription
              platform, serving over <strong>2,000,000 registered users</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kept the platform running in production for <strong>5+ consecutive years</strong>,
              solving real issues: performance bottlenecks, traffic spikes, payment failures,
              data consistency problems, server overload, and database locking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a true global e-commerce platform selling to customers in
              <strong>200+ countries</strong>. This was not just a website with global
              payment options — it was a complete system designed from the ground up
              for genuine worldwide operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and operated global payment flows, selling digital services to
              users in <strong>200+ countries</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built and operated a comprehensive subscription system for
              <strong>7 consecutive years</strong>, handling recurring payments,
              billing cycles, and subscription lifecycles. For a non-profit organization,
              I also structured and managed their revenue-generating projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Created and maintained multiple production-level apps, including AI-based tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              Currently pursuing <strong>AI-related patents</strong> based on my work
              with high-performance AI infrastructure and on-device AI systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and implemented database encryption and web application server solutions
              used in real production environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked on critical systems requiring network programming, socket monitoring,
              and driver-level reliability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Led or helped set up multiple engineering teams, from zero to a functioning
              development organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and implemented the exhibition management system for the
              <strong>National Museum of Korea</strong>, one of the world's top 5 most-visited museums.
              I architected the complete system: database infrastructure, server infrastructure,
              and applications. This project has been a source of deep cultural inspiration for me
              and has impacted many people. The system is updated monthly and will continue
              through next year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented database triple replication and infrastructure software for the
              <strong>National Assembly of Korea</strong>, and installed AI-based infrastructure
              software running on high-performance H100 GPUs. These are the kinds of systems where
              responsible users with deep expertise can also contribute to development.

          <h3>Core Technical Strength</h3>
          <h2>General Programming Languages & Databases Feel Like Home</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>General programming languages (C#, Java, C, Swift) and database systems are where I feel at home.</strong>
            This is not just a skill set for me — it is my comfort zone.
          </p>
          <p>I am deeply experienced with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Server-side systems and backend services in C#, Java, C, Swift</li>
            <li>High-performance database design and indexing</li>
            <li>Complex data pipelines and transaction-heavy business logic</li>
            <li>Long-running, mission-critical services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The kinds of database problems that many teams struggle with — slow queries,
            deadlocks, replication issues, data inconsistency, scaling bottlenecks —
            are problems I have already solved many times in production.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I work with general programming languages and databases, it feels like returning to my hometown:
            familiar, stable, and reliable. That is the level of confidence I bring
            into your system.

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <h2>How I Became This Kind of Engineer</h2>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <h3>Path</h3>

          <p><strong>Military accountant & early automation</strong><br>
            I started my career as an accounting clerk in the military. I was selected
            because I was good at fixing processes. I automated and optimized workflows
            with Excel and simple programming — it was my first taste of improving systems.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Websites and databases from age 20</strong><br>
            In my early twenties, I built websites for small businesses and managed
            databases. A professor recommended me to work at a university-affiliated
            education center, where I took care of their site and database throughout
            my college years.
          </p>

          <p><strong>E-commerce and payment gateways</strong><br>
            I worked at a large PC distribution and online sales company during the
            early days of the e-commerce boom, selling laptops and components online.
            There I learned how payment gateways, logistics, and computer distribution
            actually work. Since then I’ve often said: <em>“Life is timing.”</em>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Developer communities & content</strong><br>
            I was active as a student developer in communities supported by large
            tech-related organizations. I helped host developer meetups, created
            screencast-style technical content, and contributed small pieces to
            community projects. I learned about version control, release processes,
            and how to explain technology to other people.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Hands-on troubleshooting</strong><br>
            I worked part-time in a technical troubleshooting department, focusing
            on embedded devices and small hardware systems. There I learned how to
            investigate and solve technical issues calmly, under time pressure, and
            with incomplete information.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Critical systems in finance</strong><br>
            I joined a company that provided components for high-importance financial
            systems, working on deployment modules and tools. I learned network
            programming, socket monitoring, and low-level reliability concerns that
            arise in environments where downtime is not acceptable.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Research & product development</strong><br>
            For about seven years, I worked as a researcher/engineer at an IT solutions
            company, building database encryption solutions and web application server
            related products. I visited many client sites, listened to their needs,
            and implemented real solutions. I was given autonomy to manage my own time
            and to dive deeply into topics I loved.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Non-profit education & open knowledge</strong><br>
            I co-founded a non-profit education project with friends from the developer
            community. Our goal was to reduce information gaps and promote an
            open-knowledge culture. We collaborated with various partners, ran online
            education programs, and experimented with open-source-style learning.
            I handled development, infrastructure, and also accounting.
          </p>

          <p><strong>IT in a multi-brand environment</strong><br>
            Later, I joined the IT department of a company managing many consumer brands.
            I handled databases and related programs across more than 20 brand sites
            and worked with various external vendors. I learned how demanding real
            business environments can be — and how easily a client can become difficult
            if they forget what it feels like to be on the other side.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Solo consulting & teaching</strong><br>
            I ran my own small business as an independent consultant, working on
            database design, encryption, performance tuning, and server optimization
            for companies and institutions in different fields (finance, education,
            manufacturing, simulation, environment, and more). I also delivered
            dozens of technical lectures and mentored startup teams in training programs.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Team building & current role</strong><br>
            I helped set up development teams for startups and training companies,
            building the initial team structure and then stepping away once things
            were stable. In recent years, I’ve been leading and building an engineering
            team for a language-learning platform that teaches Korean to the world.
            The work is not perfect, but it is meaningful — and that matters to me.

          <h3>Who I Am</h3>

          <p><strong>What I can give</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deep understanding of databases and application servers</li>
            <li>Strong SQL and query design skills</li>
            <li>Experience from low-level systems to web and mobile</li>
            <li>Many years of troubleshooting strange, hard-to-reproduce problems</li>
            <li>Ability to propose multiple practical options when something breaks</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>How I work with people</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I don’t always speak in a polished way, but I often become a center of
              gravity for people, tasks, and projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can work well with “unusual” people and teams — sometimes those are
              the teams that build the most interesting things.
            </li>
            <li>
              I listen carefully and think alone. If something feels fundamentally wrong,
              I usually don’t do it — but if my behavior makes others uncomfortable,
              I try to improve.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Personality, honestly</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>From a distance, I may look normal. Up close, I can seem a bit strange.</li>
            <li>I don’t rely on automatic trust, but I like to give people hope.</li>
            <li>
              I’m not easily shaken by other people’s opinions, but if I cause discomfort,
              I work on changing that.
            </li>
            <li>I don’t always make the same choice in the same situation — I adapt.</li>
            <li>
              When I play, I look like a planner. When I work, I’m more like:
              “If it’s possible, let’s try.”
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>What I want to learn</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A “hundred hobbies”: farming, food distribution, swimming, tennis,
              weightlifting, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Soft skills: communication, leadership, teaching, and helping others grow.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Random details that still matter</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I started as an accounting clerk and still care about numbers and structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have handled both backend systems and real accounting for a non-profit.
            </li>
            <li>
              I like seasonal fruit, good conversations, and projects that mean something
              beyond money.

          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <h2>Language Is Not the Real Barrier</h2>
          <p>
            I am not a native English speaker. But I can understand most English used
            in real meetings with US and UK teams, especially in technical and product
            discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use translation tools and AI assistants to refine my writing, check nuance,
            and make sure we are aligned. This makes written communication clear and
            reliable, even across time zones.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>International Work</h3>
          <h2>Experience Across Regions</h2>
          <p>
            I have worked with teams and companies in different regions, including
            East Asia, South Asia, Europe, and North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my experience, language is rarely the real problem. The real questions are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do we share the same goals?</li>
            <li>Do we think clearly about trade-offs?</li>
            <li>Do we care enough to fix the hard parts?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I believe that with clear thinking, honest communication, and the right tools,
            we can reach our goals together. That is why I feel confident working with
            clients from any country.

    <!-- HUMAN VS AI -->

          <h3>AI Era</h3>
          <h2>AI Can Write Code. It Cannot See the Whole System.</h2>
          <p>
            Today, AI can generate code, fix syntax errors, and even suggest
            architectures. I actively use AI tools as part of my workflow.
          </p>
          <p>But real systems rarely fail because a piece of code is missing. They fail because of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wrong assumptions about users or traffic</li>
            <li>Hidden operational constraints and edge cases</li>
            <li>Business logic conflicts between teams</li>
            <li>Data that behaves differently in the real world</li>
            <li>Human decisions made under pressure</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Human Judgment</h3>
          <h2>Systems Need Multiple Perspectives at Different Abstraction Levels</h2>
          <p>
            What I bring is not only implementation. I bring a
            <strong>multi-angle, multi-level perspective</strong> that views problems from various 
            abstraction levels and different viewpoints:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple abstraction levels:</strong> From code details to high-level architecture</li>
            <li><strong>Engineering perspective:</strong> Technical implementation and performance</li>
            <li><strong>Operations perspective:</strong> How systems run in production</li>
            <li><strong>Business perspective:</strong> Costs, value, and business impact</li>
            <li><strong>Risk perspective:</strong> Failure scenarios and edge cases</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term perspective:</strong> Maintenance, evolution, and sustainability</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Good problems require viewing them from multiple angles and different levels of abstraction.</strong> 
            I can analyze your system from the ground up — from individual code paths to overall system architecture 
            — and find solutions that work at all levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI gives you speed. Human judgment with multiple perspectives determines whether your system
            survives the long term.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe great systems are built where <strong>AI speed meets human responsibility and 
            multi-dimensional thinking</strong>.

          <h2>How the $1 Model Works</h2>
          <p>
            This $1 offer is not about being cheap. It is a deliberate way to remove

            <li>
              <strong>You pay $1 to start.</strong><br />

            <li>
              <strong>If you are satisfied, we continue.</strong><br />
              We can then agree on a fair rate for implementation or ongoing consulting.
            </li>
            <li>

          <h3>Efficiency</h3>
          <h2>Server Cost Reduction Without Performance Loss</h2>
          <p>
            Many systems pay too much for infrastructure because of poor architecture,
            missing caching, or unoptimized queries.
          </p>
          <p>I specialize in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Web server tuning (reverse proxies, caching, compression)</li>
            <li>Database performance and query optimization</li>

            <li>Right-sizing and scaling without waste</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I focus on <strong>cost reduction without performance loss</strong>.
            If your system becomes cheaper but slower, that is not success.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Shared Benefit</h3>
          <h2>Fair Cost-Saving & Monthly Consulting Model</h2>
          <p><strong>The cost-saving agreement is simple and fair:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If I reduce your server or infrastructure cost without degrading
              performance, we share the savings (for example, 50/50).
            </li>
            <li>
              You keep part of the savings; I receive part of the savings as a fee.
            </li>
            <li>
              If there is no real saving, you don’t pay this fee.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After optimization, I can stay as your long-term technical partner with
            a monthly arrangement:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ongoing consulting and architecture review</li>
            <li>Monitoring and proactive adjustments</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="muted">
            The exact percentage and scope can be adjusted based on your system and
