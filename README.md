# $1 System Architect – Duru Kang

Senior system architect offering $1 consulting to solve your architecture and performance problems. Almost 20 years of serious, real-world experience in large-scale, mission-critical systems.

## What I Do

I help you design, build, or repair systems that must not fail. I approach problems from multiple angles and different levels of abstraction — from code level to architecture level, business level to operational level — to find the best solutions.

## Track Record

- Built and operated a very large WordPress + WooCommerce subscription platform, serving over **2,000,000 registered users**
- Kept the platform running in production for **5+ consecutive years**, solving real issues: performance bottlenecks, traffic spikes, payment failures, data consistency problems, server overload, and database locking
- Built a true global e-commerce platform selling to customers in **200+ countries** — a complete system designed from the ground up for genuine worldwide operation
- Designed and operated global payment flows, selling digital services to users in **200+ countries**
- Built and operated a comprehensive subscription system for **7 consecutive years**, handling recurring payments, billing cycles, and subscription lifecycles
- Designed and implemented the exhibition management system for the **National Museum of Korea**, one of the world's top 5 most-visited museums
- Implemented database triple replication and infrastructure software for the **National Assembly of Korea**, and installed AI-based infrastructure software running on high-performance H100 GPUs
- Currently pursuing **AI-related patents** based on work with high-performance AI infrastructure and on-device AI systems

## The $1 Model

Start with just $1. There's no risk:

1. **You pay $1 to start.** This confirms you are serious and opens a focused technical engagement.
2. **You describe your situation.** Email me and tell me what you need — a website, subscription site, or help with existing problems.
3. **I design or diagnose.** You receive a clear architecture or troubleshooting plan with concrete steps.
4. **If you are satisfied, we continue.** We can then agree on a fair rate for implementation or ongoing consulting.
5. **If you are not satisfied,** you only spent $1.

## Why I Can Help

I've been doing this work seriously for almost 20 years. With nearly two decades of experience, I can definitely help you. I can:

- Build websites and apps
- Create subscription systems
- Fix performance problems
- Design global payment systems
- Build large-scale email systems
- Help reduce infrastructure costs while maintaining or improving performance

**I approach problems from multiple angles and different levels of abstraction.** I can view your system from various perspectives — code level, architecture level, business level, operational level — and find the best solutions. Good problems require good solutions, and I bring multiple viewpoints to ensure we solve the right problem in the right way.

## Contact

**I prefer to communicate via email.** Share your situation — whether you need a new website, app development, a subscription site, global payment systems, large-scale email infrastructure, performance optimization, or help reducing costs — and I'll provide you with concrete solutions I can deliver.

## Technical Expertise

### Core Technical Strength

General programming languages (C#, Java, C, Swift) and database systems are where I feel at home. I am deeply experienced with:

- Server-side systems and backend services in C#, Java, C, Swift
- High-performance database design and indexing
- Complex data pipelines and transaction-heavy business logic
- Long-running, mission-critical services

The kinds of database problems that many teams struggle with — slow queries, deadlocks, replication issues, data inconsistency, scaling bottlenecks — are problems I have already solved many times in production.

## Problem-Solving Approach

What I bring is not only implementation. I bring a **multi-angle, multi-level perspective** that views problems from various abstraction levels and different viewpoints:

- **Multiple abstraction levels:** From code details to high-level architecture
- **Engineering perspective:** Technical implementation and performance
- **Operations perspective:** How systems run in production
- **Business perspective:** Costs, value, and business impact
- **Risk perspective:** Failure scenarios and edge cases
- **Long-term perspective:** Maintenance, evolution, and sustainability

Good problems require viewing them from multiple angles and different levels of abstraction. I can analyze your system from the ground up — from individual code paths to overall system architecture — and find solutions that work at all levels.
